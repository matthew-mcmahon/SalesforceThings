# ProgressIndicator with Last Step Completed

This is a progress indicator example on a Salesforce aura component that makes the last stage in current stages invisible, and alters the second to last stage to appear as the last stage - allowing it to look like the whole progressindicator is completed.

It requires a pseudo-stage as the last stage that will not be displayed in the component.
